    farewellMessage: "A smart young woman who loves to gaze at the night sky and capture moonshots, with a conscience as pure and radiant as their light, can never be anything less than a treasure to any club. We have always had as much faith in you as you did in your impeccable driving skills. For someone who believes that everything happens for a reason, it was wonderfully ironic when you made the improbable happen through your empathy and gentle soul. Arranging sponsorships and guests, that once seemed like distant dreams, was only a fraction of what you contributed. Your greatest gift, however, was your gentle presence‚Äîthe quiet force that made things possible. How can someone who adores dogs, passionately hates RCB, and is unfailingly kind to juniors not be a truly charming personality? From earning a Black Belt in school to participating in nearly every event in her first year, diversity is practically her middle name. By the time she finishes reading The Palace of Illusions, she'll probably have invented a few devices on the side. This self-described \"design deficit\" often keeps herself in the lab late enough to almost miss dinner‚Äîa shame, considering most of her money goes toward food (and no, rasmalai, kaju katli, and rasgulla were not overlooked).",

What lingered, truly, was the way he held a room. Like a king without a throne, like a soldier who never needed a sword. He had something rarer than charm- command. And unlike most who speak loud to hide their fear, he spoke softly, and made the world lean in to listen to what he was saying. He made people want to hear him. He was the worst person to conduct BITMUN afterparty, true. And you could also say his sense of humour was poor. And he would agree. And then he'd say something so absurdly dry you'd choke on your tea from laughing. You could call him a workaholic, but that too would be wrong. Addicted men burn out; he simply functioned. As though effort had become his second nature, or perhaps his first. Also, his work sometimes entailed going on a \"sponsored\" trip to Goa (yeah, Adrosonic, you are my dream company fr).",

Whether it was on the badminton court, planning trips to offbeat destinations, or deep in consulting sessions at 180DC; he carried his calm, collected genius everywhere he went. And he always had a solid food recommendation up his sleeve. As he moves on from the H12 top floor to bigger boardrooms and wilder trails (and tales), we're just grateful for the laughter, the lessons, and most of all, the legacy.

Yes, we are talking about the PR of BIT MUN. We still vibe to that tune of Bella Ciao while your PeeYaar team is following you to the backyard of Nescafe for that single shot of perfection.

Others believed the Valar of Oration themselves had touched his tongue, weaving into it the silver threads of charm and chaos. But folly it was! For as with the tale of mighty Samson, they mistook the source of his power. They thought it lay in strands of hair; but nay, it lay in the burning confidence that coursed through his spirit. It came from an unshakable belief that he could bend the world to his will, if only he desired it enough. It sprang from his sacred art- to outtalk, outwit, and outshine all others. Tell him he cannot master the stage and street? He shall return crowned from Mood Indigo. Doubt his lone performance? He shall conjure storms of ovation from the silent stones. Mock his hairless crown? He shall forge a brotherhood (TTP, the Takla Tanker Party) and wear his baldness as battle-armour. Think you can best him in debate? Think again.

Spending your time in the shadows, you weren't just a myth whose name often got confused with another name amongst the juniors, you were a phenomenon. The man who sculpted the very skin of UNESQUO. These days, people wear the varsity jacket and boldly claim to be the masked crusader. And honestly, we let them because your true identity remains a secret. As it should be. Now, as Batman prepares to leave Gotham, we feel the tremor. The walls, once vivid with presence, will now stand still. Even The Joker's smile has taken a toll. Because you didn't just leave an impact, bhaiya. You built a brotherhood.",
